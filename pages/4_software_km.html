    <h1 class="Software-paragraph"> What do Web Developers Do?</h1>
</div>

    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> Web developers create and program websites and applications. There's many duties that come with this task such as implementing graphics, audio and video into a website. They mainly write code for websites they design by using programming languages. Some of these programming languages include HTML or XML. </p>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> Web developers can make websites but who do they make it for? There are clients they respond to so they can make websites and when they meet with them, they'll make it exactly how the client wants it. They could also just make websites for companies but there's different aspects of this career too which can be customer-service oriented. When it comes to the construction of websites, there are many different aspects to it. Not all developers handle all responsbilities of maintaining and developing a website. </p>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> <b>Front-end web developers:</b> Create features to design how a website looks. They hold the responsbilities of developing the theme and layout of a website while also implementing graphics and applications. As well as other content a company or client could ask for. They also write program these websites using programming lanugages which include HTML or Javascript. </p>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> <b>Back-end web developers:</b> These developers have the duty of technically consturcting the entire website. The basic framework is created by these developers and verify that all functions are fully opertional. Procedures are also created so other developers have the accessibility to adding any page that is required for the website. Communications with management is crtical to ensure the website meets their demands.</p>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> <b>Web and digital interface designers:</b> Create the look and feel for a website and interface. Their tools to do this are color, font type and size, graphics, photos, and layout. Usuablity, functionality, and compatibility of a website or interface are ensured by these designers.    </p>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> <b>Webmasters:</b> make sure that a website is running smoothly day-day. They maintain websites and whenever they are asked to, update them. It's their responsbility that nothing occurs within the website such as an image not loading or if a link breaks. They have to make sure that none of these errors can occur and they do that by testing their program. There are webmasters that respond to users online too.   </p>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> The average yearly salary for web developers is $92,750.   </p>




    <h1 class="Software-paragraph2"> The Job Market</h1>


    <p class="Software-paragraph3"> There will be an increasing opportunity for web developers and digital designers from 2022 to 2032. There should be a sixteen percent increase from time range which is a higher percentage than most occuptations and 19,000 openings.     </p>


<div class="boxes">


<h1 class="Software-paragraph4"> What do Software Developers Do?</h1> <!-- creates a header named What do Software Developers Do? and is customized with cambria and white font with class from .css file -KM -->
<p class="Software-paragraph5"> Computer applications are created by software developers. These applications allow the users to do tasks that are programmed by these developers. They also run systems that control devices and networks. They also see what users need and design software to satisfy those needs. Software developers also create an overall application/system. They start by building these blocks and connect those blocks together to form an application. A myriad of models and daigrams are created to help other programmers. It's almost like a blueprint for the software code that programmers need. This code is then implemented in an application. Programs are also secured and verified by developers to be fully functional. Another responsbility for software developers is to  record all data of an application or system to make improvements in the future or just daily maintenance.   </p> <!-- creates a paragraph that describes what software developers do -KM -->
