    <h1 class="Software-paragraph"> What do Hardware Computer Engineers do?</h1>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> Hardware computer engineers design develop and test computer systems with its hardware. These engineers are very informative of computer architecture, digital logic design, and electronic circuits. Instead of programming like web and software developers do, computer engineers work is comprised around the phyiscal aspects of computers which includes central processing units or CPUs, memory devices, motherboards, and peripheral devices. They work with other engineers and teams to make sure the hardware components of the computer they are working on is fully functional and works at a high level. This is then integrated with software systems. They also research and establish any new technologies that come out. For example, Javascript gets updated yearly with new technology being updated. Similarly, computer engineers keep up to date with anything new they need to know about. They can also use any new technology to upgrade their projects. </p>
    <p class="Software-paragraph1"> The salary of a hardware computer engineer on a yearly average is $128,000. </p>
