They also run systems that control devices and networks. They also see what users need and design software to satisfy those needs. Software developers also create an overall application/system. They start by building these blocks and connect those blocks together to form an application. A myriad of models and daigrams are created to help other programmers. It's almost like a blueprint for the software code that programmers need. This code is then implemented in an application. Programs are also secured and verified by developers to be fully functional. Another responsbility for software developers is to  record all data of an application or system to make improvements in the future or just daily maintenance.   </p> <!-- creates a paragraph that describes what software developers do -KM -->
